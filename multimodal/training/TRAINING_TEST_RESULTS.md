## 🧠 **ARCHITECTURE INNOVATIONS**

### **Cross-Attention Fusion Mechanism**
```python
# Revolutionary approach: Text queries attend to climate
attended_features, attention_weights = self.cross_attention(
    query=text_embeddings,      # [batch, seq_len, hidden_size]
    key=climate_projected,      # [batch, time_steps, hidden_size]
    value=climate_projected     # [batch, time_steps, hidden_size]
)

# Results in dynamic, learnable climate-text relationships
# vs simple addition: text + climate (static)
```

### **Memory Optimization Strategies**
1. **Frozen Base Models**: 91-93% parameters frozen
2. **CPU Training**: No GPU memory constraints
3. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Memory-efficient backprop
4. **Single Threading**: Reduced memory overhead
5. **Aggressive Cleanup**: Memory leak prevention

### **Scalability Validation**
