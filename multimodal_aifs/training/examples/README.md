- Advanced visualization techniques
- Geographic data processing

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with `llama3_final_success.py` to understand the basic fusion approach
2. **Scale Gradually**: Move to `train_llama3_8b.py` for full training capabilities
3. **Analyze Results**: Use `spatial_comparative_analysis.py` for detailed analysis

## 🎯 Integration Notes

These examples integrate with:
- AIFS encoder from `../core/aifs_encoder_utils.py`
- Climate data utilities from `../utils/climate_data_utils.py`
- Location-aware processing from `../core/aifs_location_aware.py`
- Test infrastructure from `../tests/`
